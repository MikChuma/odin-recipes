	<h1>Baked Lemon-Pepper Chicken</h1>
	<p>Looking for a quick, easy dinner? This baked lemon-pepper chicken recipe is it.

It's so simple and delicious, you'll be making this healthy dinner again and again.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>4 (6 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
		<li>Â½ teaspoon salt, plus 1/8 teaspoon, divided</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
		<li>1 medium lemon, thinly sliced</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon pure maple syrup</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon cracked pepper</li>
	</ul>
	<ol>
		<li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
		<li>Sprinkle chicken evenly with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken; cook, undisturbed, until the underside is golden brown, about 4 minutes. Flip the chicken; arrange lemon slices around the chicken in the pan.</li>
		<li>Transfer the skillet to the oven; bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest portion of meat registers 165 degrees F, about 10 minutes.</li>
		<li>Transfer the chicken to a platter. Add lemon juice and maple syrup to the pan. Add butter, 1 piece at a time, stirring until it melts into the sauce. Stir in pepper and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt. Drizzle the sauce over the chicken.</li>
